# Shopping_Cart

When you open the project, you will be prompted to enter the id number or scan the barcode of the item (store management will need to update the dictionary to match the items). 

Once you have logged all of the items to be purchased, enter the id: "0" into the program. 

Then your receipt will be printed!
