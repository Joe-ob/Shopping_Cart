# Shopping_Cart

Download the project from github and open the shopping cart program in your terminal (For a Mac, click 'Respository' in the upper left and then click 'Open in Terminal'). In the Command Line, type "python shopping_cart.py" and press ENTER. 

You will be prompted to enter the id number or scan the barcode of the item. 

The program pulls product information from the url of the Products.csv file we used in class, if changes need to be made to the product selection, the updates need to go on the same url.

Once you have logged all of the items to be purchased, enter the id: "0" into the program to finish.

Then, your receipt will print: the time and date, the market's location, the items you ordered, the subtotal, the sales tax, and your total cost!
